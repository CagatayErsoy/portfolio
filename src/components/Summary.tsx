        Once a civil engineer, I traded blueprints for code and never looked
        back—except when debugging feels like structural failure. Now, as a Full
        Stack Developer, I’m passionate about crafting intuitive,
        high-performance user interfaces that seamlessly blend design and
        engineering. I love learning and improving every day, whether it’s
        optimizing UI components, exploring new frameworks, or figuring out why
        a div refuses to stay where it should.

        Currently, I’m a Technical Team Lead at LindoFlex, guiding a team of
        developers to build scalable, accessible frontends. While I thrive on
        problem-solving, I still refuse to like Java (no offense to Java
        enthusiasts, but we all have our limits). When I’m not coding, I’m
        probably reading, testing out new tech, or searching for the perfect way
        to beat lag in Wild Rift—because optimization doesn’t stop at work.
